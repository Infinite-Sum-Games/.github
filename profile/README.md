# Welcome to Infinite Sum Games 🚀💻
We are a rogue squadron of coding renegades who live to conquer the wildest challenges in computer science with a smirk and a spark. Our GitHub org is a digital dojo where we sling code, tame complexity, and occasionally flirt with chaos (don’t tell the servers). Ready to dive into our world of fearless programming and open-source? Buckle up.

# Our Vibe 🌶️

- **Serious Skills, Silly Souls:** We craft production-grade code by day and roast bad APIs over virtual campfires by night.
- **No Challenge Too Big:** Got an “impossible” problem? We’ll solve it, open-source it, and maybe add a snarky comment for posterity.
- **Yet-Another Peer Group:** Join us if you’re ready to code hard, laugh harder, and accidentally reinvent the wheel.

# Our Manifesto 🛠️

1. Code like it’s going to the moon, document like it’s for your grandma.
2. Respect the order, embrace the chaos.
3. Always push to main… just kidding, don’t do that. We’re watching. 👀
4. Run `Linux` or `Unix`—because real coders live in the terminal, not a GUI wonderland.
5. Code till 2 AM (or later), fueled by coffee, determination, and questionable life choices :)
6. Master terminal tools: `grep`, `zsh/nushell`, sed, and `zellij` are your best friends.
7. (Neo)Vim is life. If you’re still on VS Code, we’ll convert you (or at least stage an intervention).
8. Commit messages should be clear, concise, or hilariously cryptic—`no in-between`.
9. Debug with `strace` and `gdb` like a detective hunting bugs in the matrix.
10. Never trust a mouse; keyboards are the only path to enlightenment :)
